## Module 2: Market Structure & Liquidity

### Lesson 3: Liquidity Sweeps

You've learned to see the market's skeleton (Structure) and identify its fuel (Liquidity). Now, it's time to put it all together. This lesson reveals how institutions actively use liquidity to engineer price moves, trap unsuspecting traders, and initiate their real campaigns. This is where you shift from being the prey to understanding the predator.

**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, you will be able to identify a liquidity sweep (or stop hunt) and differentiate it from a true breakout, using it as a high-probability trade setup.

### 1. The Anatomy of a Liquidity Sweep

A Liquidity Sweep (also known as a stop hunt) is a sharp, surgical price move designed to do one thing: capture the liquidity resting just above a key high or just below a key low. Once the liquidity is taken, the price aggressively reverses.

It's a trap, and understanding its mechanics is crucial. The process unfolds in four stages:

1. **The Setup:** The market creates an obvious pool of liquidity, like the Equal Highs or Equal Lows we discussed in Lesson 2. Price begins to approach this level.
2. **The Move (Inducement):** Price pierces the key high or low. This move is an inducement—it's designed to entice traders into making a mistake.
   - It triggers the stop losses of traders betting against the move.
   - It activates the entry orders of breakout traders betting on a continuation.
   - This flurry of activity provides the liquidity that institutions need to fill their large orders.
3. **The Reversal:** Once the institutional orders are filled, there is no more reason for price to remain at that level. It reverses sharply, often leaving a long wick on the candlestick. The breakout traders are now trapped in losing positions.
4. **The Real Move:** With the market now fueled and positioned, the true institutional move begins in the opposite direction of the sweep.

### 2. The Critical Difference: Sweep vs. Break of Structure (BOS)

To a beginner, a sweep and a Break of Structure can look similar at first glance. But they signify completely opposite intentions. Differentiating between them is a vital skill.

| Feature | Liquidity Sweep (Reversal Signal) | Break of Structure (Continuation Signal) |
|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **The Move** | A fast, sharp poke through the level. | A strong, confident push through the level. |
| **The Candle** | Often closes with a long, sharp wick and a small body. | Closes as a strong, full-bodied candle outside the level. |
| **The Close** | The candle closes back inside the previous range or below/above the key level. | The candle closes confidently outside the previous range. |
| **Follow-Through** | Immediate and aggressive rejection in the opposite direction. | Price finds acceptance at the new level, often retesting it as support/resistance before continuing. |
| **Indication** | The market rejected the breakout. | The market accepted the breakout. |

**Key Takeaway:** A sweep takes liquidity and reverses. A BOS breaks a level and continues. Look at how the candle closes—it tells you the true story.

### 3. Trading the Sweep: Fading the False Move

A liquidity sweep is more than just a concept; it's a powerful, high-probability trade setup. By identifying a sweep, you are aligning yourself with the institutional flow, not fighting it.

- A **bearish sweep** occurs when price sweeps a key high (e.g., Equal Highs) and is aggressively rejected. This is a high-probability signal to look for short (sell) opportunities.
- A **bullish sweep** occurs when price sweeps a key low (e.g., Equal Lows) and is aggressively rejected. This is a high-probability signal to look for long (buy) opportunities.

You are essentially trading the "real move" that happens after the trap has been set.

### Practical Application: Identifying the Hunt

Let's look at a classic sweep of buy-side liquidity. The chart shows a clear double top, a perfect target.

Now, let's contrast that with a true Break of Structure.

Notice the difference in character. The sweep is a violent rejection. The BOS is a confident continuation.
