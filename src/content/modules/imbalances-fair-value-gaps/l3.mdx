## Lesson 3: Trading with FVGs

Now that you can spot imbalances and fair value gaps, let's discuss how to use them in a trading plan. The core idea is that price often returns to an FVG before continuing. By anticipating that retracement, you can enter at a more favorable price.

### Basic Approach
1. Identify the prevailing trend or recent displacement.
2. Mark any FVGs left behind by that move.
3. Wait for price to retrace into the gap.
4. Look for confirmation (such as a small reversal candle) and then trade in the direction of the original move.

FVGs can also act as targets. If you see an opposing gap above or below price, expect the market to seek it as a form of "cleanup" before reversing.

### Caution
- Not every gap will be filled immediately; some remain open for days or weeks.
- Combine this concept with structure and liquidity lessons from earlier modules for best results.
