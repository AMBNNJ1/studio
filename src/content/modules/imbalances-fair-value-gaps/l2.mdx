## Lesson 2: The Fair Value Gap Concept

A **Fair Value Gap (FVG)** is a specific type of imbalance. It is the range between the high of one candle and the low of a later candle when the middle candle trades so quickly that it leaves empty space. ICT teaches that these gaps represent inefficient pricing that the market often seeks to "rebalance."

```
Candle 1 high ─┐        
              │   ⟵ Fair Value Gap
Candle 2 low  ─┘
```

When price revisits the FVG, it tends to react around its midpoint. Traders watch these areas for potential entries in line with the original move.

**How to mark an FVG:**
1. Find a strong candle followed by another of the same direction.
2. Note the gap between Candle 1's high and Candle 3's low.
3. Draw a box or line across this range to project the area forward.
