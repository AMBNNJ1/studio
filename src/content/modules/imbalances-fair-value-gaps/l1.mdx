When price moves aggressively in one direction it often leaves an **inefficient** area on the chart. ICT refers to this as an *imbalance* because buy and sell orders did not properly trade back and forth. The result is a section of candles with little or no overlap between their highs and lows.

Why does this matter? Large institutions see these areas as unfinished business. They frequently pull price back to an imbalance to fill the missing orders before continuing in the original direction. Your first job is to learn to identify these fast moves so you know where the market may return.

**Characteristics of an imbalance:**

- Typically created by one or two large candles of the same color.
- The move breaks a short-term structure or sweeps liquidity, showing urgency.
- Price often revisits the midpoint of the imbalance before moving on.

Look at recent sharp expansions on your chart and mark the gaps between the candles. You'll start to notice how often price later trades back into them.
